  October 1, 2020 marks the beginning of the federal fiscal year (FY21), and with it, the infusion of a
                  new allocation of immigrant visa numbers. This infusion typically results in some forward movement in
                  Final Action Dates in the month of October. The October Visa Bulletin was published on 24/09/2020 and
                  later in the day the USCIS indicated that EB I-485 applications would be accepted based on Filing
                  Date.


This October's Visa Bulletin is unique; however, given
                  competing tensions caused by the COVID-19 global pandemic. On the one hand, diminished agency
                  processing capacity is likely to limit advancement in certain preference categories and across the
                  family-based (FB) preference categories. On the other hand, most employment-based (EB) categories have
                  the potential to experience significant forward movement, as explained further below. What remains
                  uncertain is to what extent, if any, diminished agency capacity might curb advancement in the
                  employment-based preference categories.
