              <div class="mt-2 mb-3 text-muted">Nov 29, 2020</div>
              <p class="description">The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) declared on 28/10/2020 a proposed rule to amend the
                H-1B regulations administering the process by which the annual H-1B lottery is directed.</p>
              <p class="description">If established as proposed, USCIS would initially choose enlistments (or petitions, if the enrollment cycle is suspended).
                in view of the highest Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) prevailing wage level that the offered wage approaches or surpasses.
                This would replace the random H-1B selection way. In this way, offering a Level 4 OES wages would improve the odds of selection.</p>
              <p class="description">The reason given for this proposed rule is to help counter the descending tension on the wages of U.S. laborers that is made by a yearly convergence of moderately lower-pay, new cap-subject H-1B specialists
                (i.e. Level 1 OES compensation).</p>
              <p class="description">As per the DHS, the progressions proposed in this rule would give some perspective petitioners the ability to possibly improve their opportunity of selection by agreeing to pay H-1B beneficiaries higher wages that
                equal or surpass higher prevailing wages levels.</p>
              <p class="description">DHS will open a public remark period once the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register. Interested parties will have 30 days to submit remarks pertinent to the proposed rule and 60 days to submit remarks
                pertinent to the proposed information collection. DHS will survey all appropriately submitted remarks, consider them cautiously, and draft responses prior to issuing a final rule.</p>

              <p class="description">The Administration’s broadly broadcasted and long-anticipated regulatory changes to the H-1B nonimmigrant visa classification were published inside the Federal Register on October 8, 2020, and can get on December
                7, 2020, except if enjoined. To submit a comment on the rule at the latest cutoff time of December 7, 2020, go to: <a href="http://www.regulations.gov" target="_blank">http://www.regulations.gov</a> and type in USCIS-2020-0018 in the
                search field.​</p>
              <ul>
                <h5>Speciality</h5>
                <li>The rule amends the meaning of a "specialty occupation" to demonstrate that there must be a direct connection between the necessary degree field(s) and the obligations of the position.</li>
                <li>General degrees in engineering, human sciences, business, and so on minus any additional specialization or clarification aren't adequate to fulfill claim to speciality occupation.</li>
                <li>In situations where the petitioner lists degrees in different "disparate" fields of study as the base section entry for a position, the petitioner must build up how each field of study is during a particular speciality giving "a
                  body of highly specialized knowledge" straightforwardly connected with the obligations and responsibilities of the actual position.​</li>
                <li>Where a position may permit a scope of degrees, and apply numerous bodies of exceptionally specialized knowledge, every one of those passing degree fields must be straightforwardly identified with the proffered position.​</li>
                <li>Rather than exhibiting that a bachelors’ degree is "regularly," "generally" or "typically" required; petitioners should set up that the bachelor’s degree in a specific speciality or its identical is the least necessity for entry
                  into the occupation inside the us by demonstrating that the predetermined degree might be a lways.</li>
                <li>The requirement for the occupation as a whole.</li>
                <li>The occupational requirement within the relevant industry.</li>
                <li>The petitioner’s particularized requirement or</li>
                <li>Because the position is so specialized, complex, or unique that it is necessarily required to perform the duties of the specific position.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <h5>Third-Party Worksites</h5>
                <li>The term "worksite" is revised (with the goal that it is similar to the DOL meaning of "place of employment" at 20 CFR 655.715) as "the actual area where the work is really performed by the H-1B nonimmigrant."​ </li>
                <li>The rule characterizes "third-party worksite" as "a worksite, other than the recipient's habitation in the US, that isn't possessed or rented, and not worked, by the petitioner."​</li>
                <li>The standard sets a 1-year maximum legitimacy period for all H-1B petitions in which the recipient will be working at a third-party worksite. This applies to all H-1B petitions where any recognized worksite is a third-party, not
                  simply the essential worksite​ Employer-Employee Relationship.</li>
                <li>The definition of “United States Employer” is amended by : ​Striking the word “contractor” from the definition of “United States employer,” although DHS also explains at length that the deletion does not necessarily preclude a
                  contractor from qualifying as a U.S. employer</li>
                <li>Embeddings "company" in the overall definition; and​ Developing the current necessities by necessitating that a business must draw in the recipient to work inside the US and have a genuine, non-theoretical proposition for
                  employment for the beneficiary.​ </li>
                <li>The solicitor must set up that a genuine proposition for employment exists, and that real work will be accessible as of the mentioned start date.​ </li>
                <li>The rule defines the expression "employer-employee relationship" to be the "conventional master-servant relationship as perceived by custom-based law organization principle." It includes a non-exhaustive list of factors to be
                  considered in the totality of the circumstances, essentially restoring the January 2010 Neufeld Memo on the employer-employee relationship that was recently invalidated. In any case, moreover to taking viable whether a business has
                  "the option to control" the worker's work together of the listed variables, USCIS likewise will look at whether the business really practices that privilege to control. This may require staffing organizations to put a chief at every
                  customer site where they have workers.</li>
                <li>The rule requires that petitioners filing third-party worksite petitions must submit evidence such as
                  contracts, work orders, or other similar evidence (such as a detailed letter from an authorized official at
                  the third-party worksite) to determine that the beneficiary will perform services during a specialty
                  occupation which the petitioner will have an employer-employee relationship with the beneficiary. Such
                  documentation can also be requested by USCIS for any and every one H-1B petitions during a
                  case-by-case basis.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <h5>Other Provisions</h5>
                <li>The rule requires USCIS to issue a quick explanation when an H-1B nonimmigrant petition is approved
                  but USCIS grants an earlier end validity date than requested by the petitioner.​</li>
                <li>The rule revises the itinerary requirement at 8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(i)(B) to specify that this provision will
                  not apply to H-1B petitions.​</li>
                <li>The rule adds provisions regarding H-1B site visits to codify its authority to conduct site visits and
                  describe the scope of inspections.</li>
                <li>The regulation indicates that the possible scope of an inspection may include the petitioning
                  organization’s headquarters, satellite locations, or the location where the beneficiary works or will work,
                  including third-party worksites, as applicable.​</li>
                <li>The rule also specifies that failure or refusal of the petitioner or a third-party to cooperate with a site
                  visit may be grounds for denial or revocation of any H-1B petition for H-1B workers performing services
                  at the situation or locations which are a topic of inspection, including any third-party worksites.</li>

              <div style="border-bottom:6px solid #0956A4;"></div>
              <div class="mt-2 mb-3 text-muted">Nov 10, 2020</div>
              <p class="description">On October 6, 2020, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) updated its regulations for wages paid to
                certain foreign workers with the named purpose of higher protecting the roles and wages of U.S.
                workers. The new wages were applicable as of October 7, 2020 at 7:00 pm.​</p>
              <p class="description">AILA (American Immigration Lawyers Association) is preparing litigation against the DOL regarding this
                alteration . If you'd wish to be a named plaintiff during this matter, please read through to the top of this
                alert for information on the way to join as a plaintiff. Both organizations and individuals could also be
                included as named plaintiffs.</p>
              <ul>
                <h5>Prevailing wages established by the DOL impact the subsequent nonimmigrant and immigrant categories:</h5>
                <li>H-1B</li>
                <li>H-1B1 (Singapore/Chile trade Agreement)</li>
                <li>E-3 (Australia trade Agreement)​</li>
                <li>Employment-based positive identification sponsorships supported a PERM application.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The Department believes these changes to the wage structure supported the Occupational Employment
                Statistics (OES) wage survey better reflect the particular wages earned by U.S. workers similarly
                employed to foreign workers. The OES is that the online wage survey administered by the Bureau of
                Labor Statistics and typically utilized in reference to H-1B petitions. during this regard, please note that
                the prevailing wage levels appear to possess been increased by about 50% in many cases. Under the new
                wage structure, A level 1 (entry level) engineer in Wayne/Oakland/Macomb county must be paid
                $92,830/year ($44.63/hour). this is often up from $67,850/year ($32.62/hour). A level 2 engineer
                working within the same geographic location must now be paid $114,421/year ($55.01/hour), up from
                $82,555/year ($39.69/hour).</p>
              <ul>
                <h5>The Interim Final Rule will only apply to the following</h5>
                <li>An Application for Prevailing Wage Determination, Form ETA-9141 (typically filed in reference to PERM
                  sponsorship), pending with the National Prevailing Wage Center (NPWC) as of 08/10/2020.</li>
                <li> An Application for Prevailing Wage Determination, Form ETA-9141, filed with the NPWC on or after 08/10/2020.</li>
                <li>A Labor Condition Application for Nonimmigrant Workers (LCA), Form ETA-9035/9035E, (filed in
                  reference to H-1B, H-1B1 and E-3 petitions) filed on or after 10/8/2020 where the OES survey data is that
                  the prevailing wage source, and where the employer didn't obtain the prevailing wage determination
                  from the NPWC before the effective date of the regulation.</li>
                <p><strong>Note: </strong>If the legal challenge to the present rule isn't successful, it's going to be worth investing in an
                  independent wage survey that might be acceptable to the DOL. For now, i like to recommend taking a
                  wait and see approach because the new rule might be blocked by the courts.</p>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <h5>The Interim Final Rule won't impact the following</h5>
                <li>Prevailing Wage Determinations (ETA-9141) issued any time before 10/08/2020. Including those issued
                  years ago in reference to a PERM and/or I-140 that has already been approved. This includes EB3
                  downgrades that are being prepared.</li>
                <li>Existing H-1B, H-1B1 or E-3 wages. So, there's no impact to the wage levels for workers who have a
                  pending or approved H-1B, H-1B1 or E-3. However, the new wage structure will apply subsequent time
                  the employer files an extension or amendment for the worker.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>On October 13, 2020, the NPWC will begin issuing prevailing wage determinations (ETA-9141) using the
                new OES prevailing wage data. This brief delay in issuing wage determinations is important to finish the
                specified technical changes to the FLAG system's internal prevailing wage determination module.</p>
              <p>The DOL are going to be accepting public comments on the new rule through 11/9/2020. To submit a

                H-1B, H-1B1, E-3 and PERM filings. Individuals and organizations curious about potentially joining the

                premium processing services to other application types. To date, premium processing has only been
                available for some I-140 petitions and nonimmigrant petitions filed using Form I-129 (H-1B, L-1, O-1, TN,

              <p class="description">We previously reported that on August 3, 2020, that USCIS had published a final rule that was to
                increase certain immigration and naturalization filing fees beginning October 2, 2020.</p>
              <p class="description">The Immigrant Legal Resource Center had filed suit against USCIS regarding the fee increases
                and on 29/09/2020, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ordered that the
                USCIS filing fee increases be stayed pending final adjudication of the matter. This also means
                that premium processing time limit will remain 15 calendar days for now, rather than 15
                business days as had been proposed in the final rule. </p>
              <p class="description">This is particularly important now as the USCIS filing fees for I-485 and associated applications
                (EADs and Advance Parole application) were set to substantially increase on October 2, just as
                thousands of people will be filing their I-485 applications due to rapid forward movement in
                priority dates. </p>

              <div style="border-bottom:6px solid #0956A4;"></div>
              <div class="mt-2 mb-3 text-muted">Oct 30, 2020</div>
              <p class="description">On September 3, 2020, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) submitted an Interim
                Final Rule to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office of
                Management and Budget (OMB) entitled, "Strengthening the H-1B Nonimmigrant Visa
                Classification Program." It is anticipated that the administration will publish the regulation as an
                Interim Final Rule (IFR), rather than as a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), which would
                normally first require a 60-day comment period. An IFR means that the regulation would take
                effect possibly upon publication - without the agency first evaluating and responding to public
                comments. </p>
              <p class="description">On September 16, 2020, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) submitted an Interim Final Rule to
                OIRA entitled, "Restructuring of H-1B/H-1B1/E-3 and PERM Wage Levels." It is anticipated that
                the administration also plans to publish this regulation as an Interim Final Rule and that it could
                become effective immediately upon publication. </p>
              <p class="description">The timing of these regulations is crucial as, with the election coming in November and the
                possibility of a change of administration coming in January, the clock is ticking on this
                administration's ability to promulgate new regulations to implement its restrictionist agenda. </p>
              <p class="description">The USCIS and DOL Interim Final Rules are expected to combine to substantially modify
                prevailing wage requirements so as to limit the availability of the H-1B visa program to the most
                highly paid professionals, regardless of actual wage data for the labor market.
                These are some highlights of several expected provisions of these regulations, and a preview of
                potential legal challenges these regulations may face.</p>
              <ul>
                <h5>Expected Provisions</h5>
                <p>While the specific language of the forthcoming regulations will not be available until they are
                  published in the Federal Register, based on the regulatory agenda and other clues, they are
                  expected to include the following:</p>
                <li><strong>Revision of the definition of an H-1B specialty occupation to "increase focus on
                    obtaining the best and brightest foreign nationals."</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Changes to the definitions of H-1B employment and the employer-employee
                    relationship, with a focus on restricting offsite placement of H-1B workers.</strong> It is
                  expected that the Interim Final Rule will revise the regulatory definition of "United
                  States Employer" and the interpretation of "employer-employee relationship" so as to
                  exclude or limit the availability of the H-1B visa program where there is third-party
                  placement of H-1B workers. </li>
                <li><strong>Possible requirement that H-1B employers and their end clients jointly obtain LCAs
                    where H-1B workers will work at client sites.</strong> The regulation may include a revision to
                  the Labor Condition Application (LCA) requirement so that when the H-1B worker is
                  assigned to a third-party work site, the end-client would need to join in or be a signatory
                  to the LCA. A joint LCA requirement may create de facto joint employer liability for LCA
                  obligations on wages and working conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Additional H-1B wage requirements "to ensure employers pay appropriate wages to
                    H-1B visa holders" as well as a restructuring of the H-1B, H-1B1, E-3 and PERM
                    prevailing wage levels.</strong> </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <h5>Litigation Challenging the Regulations </h5>
                <p>A few grounds for a legal challenge could include: </p>
                <li>Several of the expected changes appear to be inconsistent with existing statutes on
                  specialty occupation. </li>
                <li>If issued as an Interim Final Rule, the agency will also need to show the basis for its
                  determination that there exists "good cause" to skip the normal notice and comment
                  process.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Reforming (read: restricting) the H-1B visa program is a priority for Senior Policy Advisory
                Stephen Miller. However, issuing these regulations as Interim Final Rules presents many risks
                and makes a successful legal challenge more likely. If a federal court issues an injunction
                following a legal challenge, it is unlikely that there would be enough time to republish a
                regulation and consider public comments - unless there is a second term of the Trump
                Presidency. </p>

              <div style="border-bottom:6px solid #0956A4;"></div>
              <div class="mt-2 mb-3 text-muted">Oct 25, 2020</div>
              <p class="description">October 1, 2020 marks the beginning of the federal fiscal year (FY21), and with it, the infusion
                of a new allocation of immigrant visa numbers. This infusion typically results in some forward
                movement in Final Action Dates in the month of October. The October Visa Bulletin was
                published on 24/09/2020 and later in the day the USCIS indicated that EB I-485 applications
                would be accepted based on Filing Date. </p>
              <p class="description"><strong>Unique forward movement </strong>This October's Visa Bulletin is unique; however, given competing tensions caused by the
                COVID-19 global pandemic. On the one hand, diminished agency processing capacity is likely to
                limit advancement in certain preference categories and across the family-based (FB) preference
                categories. On the other hand, most employment-based (EB) categories have the potential to
                experience significant forward movement, as explained further below. What remains uncertain
                is to what extent, if any, diminished agency capacity might curb advancement in the
                employment-based preference categories. </p>
              <p class="description"><strong>Infusion of unused Family-Based Numbers from FY20</strong> For FY21, the assignment of employment-based visa numbers is required to be phenomenally high. This is on the grounds that the INA requires unused
                family-based visa numbers from the prompt earlier monetary year to be added to the business based assignment (and the other way around). There were critical business based numbers utilized in FY20 before the Coronavirus pandemic
                started, while interestingly there has been negligible FB number utilization due to amazingly restricted consular preparing because of the pandemic and the foreigner visa limitations of PP 10014 that suspended settler visa preparing
                at U.S. Departments.</p>
              <p class="description">It is possible that 250,000 or more unused FB immigrant visa numbers will be added to the EB
                immigrant visa pool for FY21. This would represent a 63% increase over the highest allocation in
                recent memory. While this is great news for individuals who have been waiting many years for
                their priority dates to become current, it will likely also result in a slowdown in processing​
                I-485 and related applications.</p>
              <p class="description">On the other hand, for FY21, it is expected that the usage of family-based immigrant visas will
                continue to be significantly low in comparison to prior fiscal years due to the continuing global
                pandemic and the various travel bans that remain in effect. So, it's possible that EB visa
                numbers will continue to exhibit substantial forward movement in FY22. </p>
              <p class="description"><strong>Downsizing to EB3</strong> For certain classes, particularly those brought into the world in India and China, EB3has really pushed forward of EB2 for October 2020. For cases in which a representative has
                an endorsed I-140 in the EB2 classification, we can simultaneously document another I-140 request with the I-485 recording to downsize the appeal to EB3 and exploit the current EB3 need date.</p>
              <p class="description"><strong>Our arrangement and your things to do</strong> We are currently producing reports to see which people have current need dates dependent on their current arrangement (for example EB2) and which people
                wouldshould be downsized to EB3 to be current in October. On the off chance that your need date is current dependent on your current classification (for example EB2 India), there is no compelling reason to contact our office. We will
                start your I-485 as quickly as time permits. On the off chance that you should be minimized to EB3 or if our office didn't set up your I-140 however is as of now speaking to your boss, if you don't mind contact ouroffice to ensure we
                have you on our rundown in the event that you have not effectively done as such. At that point, we will start starting these I-485 cases and messaging the surveys that should be finished and the rundown of archives we will require. If
                it's not too much trouble check your garbage/spam envelopes every day to ensure that our introduction messages don't wind up there. </p>
              <p class="description"><strong>Employment and Travel Authorization documents </strong> Starting in October 2020, the USCIS has forced separate documenting charges for work (EAD $550) and travel (advance parole or AP $590) applications.
                Beforehand, there were no extra USCIS documenting expenses related with these applications on the off chance that they were recorded along with the I-485 (green card) application. Because of this change, we might be getting ready
                EAD/AP applications on the off chance that you explicitly request that we, besides in some uncommon conditions where the EAD/AP applications will be needed; for instance, in the event that you are in a nonimmigrant status that doesn't
                allow settler purpose like F-1 or TN. Should you decide to have us get ready EAD/AP applications, there are no extra lawful charges for the underlying applications whenever arranged simultaneously asthe I-485 application. Be that as
                it may, if the EAD/AP reports should be restored later on, which is likely, you will bring about extra lawful charges and USCIS recording expenses for the restoration applications. In the event that you decide not to apply for EAD/AP
                records you should keep up your nonimmigrant status and should have a legitimate H or L visa stamp in your identification to go universally and re-visitation of the U.S. while the I-485 is forthcoming.</p>
